# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install dependencies needed to run our app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

You can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

# Now you are ready to go!
